# Bookstore website with a Microservices Architecture

This repository shows the development of a bookstore website using the microservices architecture.
To implement this architecture, I used:
* the latest version of Java, Java 11;
* the latest version of Spring Boot, Spring Boot 2.3.5;
* Docker to package the application;
* and Kubernetes to manage the microservices.

## Chapter 1

In this first chapter, I've created a dummy application with Spring Boot. This application will only have
an endpoint which returns a string "Hello World". From this application, I've created a docker
container to have the packaged application.

I've used Minikube to have a set of virtual machines used for the Kubernetes cluster. Minikube will have
all the features needed to deploy my dummy application.

Nevertheless, I must build my Docker image in the Minikube cluster to allow Minikube retrieve it when
deploying the Kubernetes configuration.

With Kubernetes, I've declared a deployment for my packaged application, and pushed to the Minikube cluster.
From the deployment, I've added a Kubernetes service to have my dummy application available publicly.

And finally, exposed the dummy service to my localhost from Minikube. This way, I can request it.
